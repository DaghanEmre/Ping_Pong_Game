# Ping_Pong_Game

In this experiment you are expected to write a ping-pong game. The program’s description will be read from an input file ( Input.txt ) and program’s
results should be written to the output file ( Result.txt ).
The ping-pong game will be played via the commands given in the input
file. In Figure 1, a visualization is given for a sample game. As can be seen,
there are two vertical bars (blue bars) which represent the players which are
positioned outside the ball field. There is also a ball moving in the field. In
the figure, several balls of different colors are illustrated to explain the game
constraints.
